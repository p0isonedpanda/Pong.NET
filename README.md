# Pong.NET
So this is my second attempt at making pong from scratch (first attempt plus more info on this challenge can be found here https://github.com/p0isonedpanda/PythonPong) and all the same things apply. I just got annoyed at python for various reasons and deicded to move over to C#, at least temporarily. I may or may not return to python to finish what I began, but for now this game shall be made in python.

This game is likely to be buggy and overall not that great, but it's intended as a learning experience so I don't really mind.
